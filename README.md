## 🧠 About

Zecure is a **modular AI cybersecurity framework** built to detect and neutralize threats **before they reach you** — powered by **autonomous AI agents**, real-time inference, and seamless edge-to-cloud protection.

> Born from a hackathon. Built for the world.  
> Zecure is your digital bodyguard for phishing, fraud, data leaks, and everything in between.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🧠 **Agentic AI**: Modular agents (`PhisherHawk`, `TransactionSage`, `LeakSniper`) for task-specific security  
- 🌐 **Full-Spectrum Defense**: CLI, browser extension, real-time server monitoring  
- 🔄 **Autonomous Retraining**: Self-learning models adapt continuously  
- 🧪 **Simulation Lab**: Test Zecure in a sandbox before going live  
- 📊 **Sleek UI**: Control panel with a 3D threat globe and agent insights
