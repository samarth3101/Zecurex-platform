✨ The AI Agent That Watches Over You
Zecure is an award-winning, fintech-grade AI system engineered to be your ultimate cybersecurity bodyguard. Born from a hackathon vision, Zecure moves beyond reactive defense, offering proactive, intelligent protection against the most insidious digital threats across every digital touchpoint: your command line, web browser, and cloud environments.    

We believe in a world where digital safety is effortless. Zecure achieves this by combining modular AI agents, real-time inference, and autonomous retraining to constantly evolve and stay ahead of fraudsters, phishers, data leaks, and emerging threats.    

🚀 What Makes Zecure Unstoppable?
🧠 Agentic Intelligence: Powered by a swarm of specialized AI agents like PhisherHawk (phishing detection), TransactionSage (fraud scoring), and LeakSniper (dark web monitoring), each autonomously working to secure your digital footprint.    

🌐 End-to-End Protection: From your browser extension blocking scam links in real-time to a powerful CLI for deep system scans, Zecure covers all angles.    

🔄 Autonomous Retraining: Our models don't just detect; they learn. Zecure continuously retrains itself, adapting to new threats and refining its defenses without human intervention.    

📊 Intuitive Control: Visualize global threats on a dynamic 3D map, monitor agent activity, and gain actionable insights from a sleek web UI.

🧪 Simulation Playground: Test Zecure's prowess in a safe, simulated environment, watching it neutralize attacks before they ever reach your live systems.
